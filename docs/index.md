### Overview

This is the documentation for my build of a mechanized sand "zen" table. I started this project in 2008,
inspired by the artistic work of [Bruce Shapiro](http://www.taomc.com). Unfortunately, I didn't have the
expertise or access to supplies to complete my build at that time. I restarted my build process in 2018
and found a community of others people who have built similar tables.

The purpose of this site is to document my process and hopefully help others who are interested in building
something similar. If there's one thing that's certain, it's that there is no single way to do this, and
everyone has access to different budgets and supplies - I've seen tables made from 3D printed parts and
tables made from balsa wood and hot glue.

The goal for my build was to build an XY-plotter in as high-quality a way as possible, using parts that can
almost entirely be purchased online.
