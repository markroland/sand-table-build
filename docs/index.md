## Project Overview

In 2008 I started building a mechanized sand table that was directly inspired by the artwork of
[Bruce Shapiro](http://www.taomc.com).
My goal was to turn his artistic medium into a functional piece of furniture that could serve as both
an input and output device for networked information. This project was developed as part of
my Master's degree in the Arts Computation Engineering program at the University of California, Irvine.

I started building my project from pieces of a large-format printer, without any knowledge of
<abbr title="Computer Numerical Controlled">CNC</abbr> devices. Based on a
few images I had seen of Sisyphus tables, I started building a radial plotter design. My approach
required a slip ring and unfortunately
I wasn't able to fabricate or source one at that time. My attention turned to finishing the written portion of
my thesis, and I never completed my table.

I kept my incomplete work, always hoping to have the opportunity to resume the project. Between 2008 and 2018
many advances were made in electronics, noteably 
[Arduino boards](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/boards) and the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/),
as well as knowledge-sharing platforms like [YouTube](https://youtube.com).

In 2016 Bruce ran a very successful [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1199521315/sisyphus-the-kinetic-art-table)
campaign to turn his Sisyphus table into a consumer-oriented furniture piece. I actually didn't learn about the Sisyphus Kickstarter campaign until May of 2018. It motivated me to start
looking into what it would take to resume my project and that's when this iteration of the project was born.

**My goals for this project are to:**

 [x] Build a working plotter into my existing table
 [x] Create algorithmic sand patterns and open source the code used for creating them
 [ ] Create a public web site that allows visitors to send patterns to the table to be drawn
 [ ] Link static and/or dynamic patterns to represent dynamic data sources (part of the original vision for [Gravitable](https://markroland.com/portfolio/gravitable))
 [x] Add LED lighting to the table
 [x] Share my research and development process along the way

Since resuming my work I have found many other sand table builds, and if there's one thing that's certain,
it's that there is no single way to build one. Everyone has access to different budgets,
supplies and tools. I've seen tables made from 3D printed parts and
others made from balsa wood and hot glue. With limited access to machining tools, it's important for my project
to use as many pre-fabricated components as possible. Additionally, I prefer to use supported and well-documented
components over inexpensive, undocumented ones, so I have prioritized those over cheapers options.
